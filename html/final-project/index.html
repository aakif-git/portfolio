    <h1>Welcome to My Portfolio</h1>
    <p>an aspiring front-end developer with a strong interest in creating responsive, accessible, and beautiful web applications. I believe that great web experiences come from thoughtful design, clean code, and a deep understanding of user needs.

My journey in web development began with a curiosity for how websites work, and quickly grew into a passion for building interfaces that are both functional and visually engaging. I enjoy working with HTML, CSS, and modern design principles to develop pages that look great on any screen and are usable by everyone — including those with accessibility needs.

This portfolio showcases some of the projects I’ve created as I’ve learned and grown in this field. Whether it’s a simple static page or a fully responsive layout using Flexbox and CSS Grid, I focus on writing clean, maintainable code and delivering a polished user experience.

I'm continuously learning new technologies and best practices to improve my skills. My goal is to contribute to meaningful projects that make a positive impact through the web.

Thanks for visiting my portfolio — feel free to browse my work, connect with me, or reach out through the contact form!</p>

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p> a creative and motivated individual with a passion for web design and front-end development. I’m passionate about crafting clean, modern user experiences and constantly pushing myself to learn new technologies and design trends that enhance how people interact with the web.

From designing layouts to writing code, I enjoy every step of the development process — especially the part where ideas come to life in the browser. My focus is on building responsive, accessible, and user-friendly websites that not only look great but also function smoothly across all devices.

I’m committed to continuous learning and growth in the ever-evolving world of web development. Whether I’m exploring CSS animations, experimenting with new frameworks, or refining my UI/UX skills, I’m always working to improve both the visual and functional aspects of my work.

This website is a reflection of my journey so far — a space where I share what I’ve built, what I’ve learned, and what I’m striving toward next.</p>
